    // The purpose of this test is to verify that JUnit is working correctly.
    // If this test fails, it indicates a problem with the test setup.
    // This is a simple sanity check test.
    // It does not test any application logic.
    // If you see "JUnit runs!" in the output, the test passed.
    // If you do not see it, there is an issue with the test configuration.
    // This test should always pass.
    // You can add more meaningful tests in the future.
    // For now, this is just to ensure the testing framework is functioning.
    // Run this test to confirm JUnit is set up correctly.
    // If you are using an IDE, you can right-click and run this test directly.
    // If you are using Maven, you can run "mvn test" to execute this test.
    // If you are using Gradle, you can run "gradle test" to execute this test.
    // This test does not require any dependencies or special setup.
    // It is a basic test to confirm the testing environment is operational.
    // If this test fails, check your project configuration and dependencies.
    // This test is intentionally simple and does not cover any application functionality.
    // It is purely for verifying the test framework.
